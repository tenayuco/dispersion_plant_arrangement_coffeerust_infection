# Figure Codes

**1- onePlant_Data**

This folder contains the following **files**:

**bajadaPatung_onePlant**: This folder contains all the output of the supercomputer. In this case each of the internal folders is empty but must be filled with the oneplant simulation code

**dataIndividualPlant.csv**: This is the general database for the different gamma and io values to produce Fig.3 AB. from the paper.

**examplesIndividualPlant.csv**: This is the database of specific dynamics produced by **generatorExamples_onePlant.py**. It will be used to run the Fig. 3 CD.

And the following **scripts**: 

**onePlant_dataBaseModification**: This scripts creates the general average data for one plant from the output of the general simulations (bajadaPatung_oneplant). (see general readme and scheme for more detail)
**generatorExamples_onePlant.py**: This script can generate examples for user specified parameters and conditions for one plant


**2.lattice_Data**

This folder contains the following **files**:


**bajadaPatung_fullLattice**: This folder contains all the output of the supercomputer. In this case each of the internal folders is empty but must be filled with the fulllattice simulation code


**dataGeneralAverages.csv**: This is the general database for the different m, gamma, io and patterns conditions for the full lattice visualizations. 

**dataPeaks.csv**: This is the database of the peaks of individual plants and the time to reach it.

And the following **script**: 

**dataBaseModification**: This scripts creates the general average data **dataGeneralAverages.csv** and **dataPeaks.csv** from the output of full_lattice_simulation. 


**3.output_figures**

This folder contains all the generated figures by code_Figures.rmd 

**4.code_Figures.rmd**

This script generates Fig.3, 4, 5, 6, S1.3, S1.4, S1.5
