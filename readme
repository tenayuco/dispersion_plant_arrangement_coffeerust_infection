# General Codes for MoraVanCauwelaert

This folder contains all the requirements to run the model and generate the different outputs as dataframes. It also has the scripts to modify this outputs and generate the different figures of the paper. 

Nonetheless it is important to note 2 things:

1. To produce the general output per simulation (one plant simulation, full lattice simulation with the different characteristics for the suppl figures) we need to run the codes in condor (as specified in intern "readmes"). These dataframes are then modified with the scripts named **databasemodification** (and similar). But, to produce the figure directly we also added in the **FiguresCodes**, **SupplementaryFigures** the final and modified database for each figure. 

2. It is important to keep the files, databases and scripts in this structure, since all the directories of the scripts are relative. 


## onePlantSimulation

This folder contains all the necessary scripts to run the one-plant simulation in an external supercomputer. (more details in the inside readme).

## fullLatticeSimulation

This directory contains all the necessary scritps to run the full-lattice simulation in an external supercomputer. (more details in the inside readme)

## FigureCodes

Contains all the necessary data base (the modified ouput of the full_lattice and oneplant simulations) to run figures 3, 4, 5, 6, s1.4, s1.5

## Figure2_code 

Contains all the databased sistematized from different papers and the script to run the Figure 2 (spores and rains vs time)

## Supplementary Figures

Contains all the necessary data bases (the ouput of the euler and sens analysis) to run all figures S1.6 and S1.7
