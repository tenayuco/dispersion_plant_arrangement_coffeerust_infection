Each of the directories contains the database and scripts for the generation of the figures or the simulations. 

*onePlantSimulation*

This directory contains all the necessary scritps to run the one-plant simulation in an external supercomputer. (more details in the inside readme)

*full_lattice_simulation*


This directory contains all the necessary scritps to run the full-lattice simulation in an external supercomputer. (more details in the inside readme)

The outputs of each code must be defined by the user (see inside readme). 

FigureCodes

Contains all the necessary data base (the ouput of the full_lattice and oneplant simulations) to run all the figures, except for the rain vs spores vs time figure (Fig. 2) and Fig 1 that was created in inkscape. 

Figure2_code. 

Contains all the databased sistematized from different papers and the script to run the Figure 2 (spores and rains vs time)
